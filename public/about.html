  Hello there! I'm Rujul Pritwani, an 18-year-old with a passion for learning
  and an unwavering commitment to pursuing academic excellence. Let me take you
  on a simple and honest journey through my life so far.

<p>
  Education has always been a cornerstone of my life, and I'm currently on the
  path of pursuing a B.Tech degree from Netaji Subhas University of Technology.
  This educational journey has not only broadened my horizons but has also
  enriched my understanding of the world around me.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently strived to achieve my
  best. With dedication and perseverance, I managed to secure an impressive 92%
  in both my 10th and 12th-grade examinations. These marks not only reflect my
  academic prowess but also stand as a testament to my commitment to learning
  and growth.

  Beyond the confines of the classroom, I've had the incredible opportunity to
  participate in school Olympiads and inter-school competitions. These
  experiences have not only allowed me to challenge myself but have also honed
  my problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities. I am proud to have
  clinched numerous medals in these events, as they remind me of the hard work I
  put in and the joy of pushing my boundaries.

  When I'm not engrossed in my studies, you can find me exploring various
  interests. I have a strong passion for anime, movies, and sports, which offer
  me an escape into captivating narratives and the thrill of competition.
  Whether I'm immersed in the world of anime, enjoying the cinematic journey of
  movies, or actively participating in sports, I find these activities to be
  both entertaining and rejuvenating.
</p>
<p>
  As I continue on this journey of self-discovery and growth, I am excited to
  see where life's path takes me next. My story is one of determination,
  learning, and embracing opportunities with open arms. I invite you to join me
  on this expedition as I strive to make the most of every moment and create a
  meaningful impact on the world around me.
